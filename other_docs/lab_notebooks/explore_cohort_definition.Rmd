Defining general surgery surgeons is difficult because we don't have complete data for fellowship training records. As June 2021, we have ABS and fellowship council data that contain fellowship training information. 

Below we are going to explore 3 different ways to define general surgery surgeons, and their pros and cons for using each definition.

# Cohort definition

## 1. Exclude fellowship-trained surgeons using ABS and fellowship council data

**Pros**: 

1. ABS and fellowship council data have reliable fellowship training data. 
2. Most ABS and fellowship council surgeons records have matched NPIs.


**Cons**: 

1. Can't exclude fellowship trained surgeons who were not in ABS or fellowship council data. ABS and fellowship council only have a subset of fellowship training programs. ABS fellowship includes Vascular, Pediatric, Oncology and Critical Care. fellowship council includes Adv GI, Bariatric, Colorectal, Flexible Endoscopy, HPB and Thoracic.

2. ABS and fellowship council data don't have complete NPI. 56% of ABS surgeons have NPI; 80% of fellowship council data have matched NPI.

dataset at */Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs_medicare_10_20yr.rdata*


## 2. Exclude fellowship-trained surgeons using ABS, fellowship council and medicare specialty code

The same as option 1 but added medicare specialty as an additional data source. medicare specialty code was from Carrier file. Only surgeons who have only filed as general surgery specialty in carrier file are considers general surgery surgeons.

**Pros**

1. Using medicare specialty code excluded most of the specialty trained surgeons.

**Cons**

1. Medicare specialty code excluded a lot general surgery surgeons. 
2. Among the excluded surgeons(based on medicare specialty code only group), 85% of the surgeons were identified as general surgery surgeons based on NPPES dataset. 
3. I also manually checked 10 surgeons for their specialty info on their personal websites among the exclude surgeons cohort. 6 out of 10 were general surgery surgeons. 

**Cohort definition diagram**

The two diagrams below compare the differences between adding medicare specialty code filter vs. not.

dataset at */Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs_medicare_10_20yr_medicare_splty.rdata*


## 3. Exclude non-GS surgeons by practice patterns, i.e. surgeon who don't perform cases like general surgery surgeons using number of types of procedures as threshold. 

N types of procedures is defined using median number of types of procedures performed in ABS medicare data cohort. N = 21.

**Pros**: 

1. Don't need to rely on our incomplete fellowship training data. 

**Cons**: 

1. Hard to define how many types of procedures a surgeon should perform to be defined as a general surgery surgeon.

# Table1 and model results on cohort definition
