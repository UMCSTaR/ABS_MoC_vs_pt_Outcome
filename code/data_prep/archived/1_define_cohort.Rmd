This document describes how the ABS maintenance of certification and medicare outcomes cohort was defined. The data will be used for further statistical analyses.

## 1. Data Sources

- ABS certification data (received at September 2019 from ABS)
- Fellowship Council data (**Need to incorporate Angie's updates from Bariatric project**)
- Medicare claim data
  - Year: 2007-2018
  - Procedures: commonly performed general surgery procedures (162 procedures in total)
  
ABS and Medicare claim data are linked using physician NPIs. ABS and Fellowship council data are used to exclude fellowship trained surgeons.

## 3. Data Process

### ABS
  

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# ABS data prep -----------------------------------------------------------
abs = data.table::fread("/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/Surgeon Profile data/abs_with_npi.csv", colClasses = c('npi'='character'))

# nrow(abs) #51624
# gs_residency_yog combined info from AMA and ABS to get the graduation year
```


```{r abs_gs}
selected_abs = abs %>% 
  mutate(npi = as.character(npi),
         # initial certification
         pass_CE = ifelse(PFfirstCE == "p" | !is.na(Gcertyear), "passed", "failed")
         ) %>% 
  select(npi, sex, gs_residency_yog, Gcertyear, Gcompyear, ReCeverPassed,
         pass_CE, nAttemptsReCert, PFfirstR, us_medschool, gs_specialty_cms, fellowship) 

# filter passed initial certification -----------------------------------------------------------
abs_cert = selected_abs %>% 
  filter(pass_CE == "passed")

# nrow(abs_cert) # 44338
# filter Fellowship trained  -----------------------------------------------------------
if (medicare_gs_splty == FALSE) {
  abs_gs = abs_cert %>%
    filter(fellowship == "FALSE")
} else if (medicare_gs_splty == TRUE) {
  # filter based medicare specialty 
  abs_gs = abs_cert %>%
    filter(fellowship == "FALSE", gs_specialty_cms == "TRUE")
}

```



```{r}
# filter additional fellowship trained surgeons from fellowship council data
fellow_council = data.table::fread("/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/Surgeon Profile data/fellowship_council/fellowship_npi_manual_linked.csv")

abs_gs = abs_gs %>% 
  filter(!npi %in% fellow_council$npi)
```


```{r }
# nrow(abs_gs) #33461
n_exclude = nrow(abs_cert)-nrow(abs_gs)
```

```{r}
# 2017 as the last year
abs_gs_2017 = abs_gs %>% 
  mutate(cutoff_2007 = ifelse(Gcertyear+10>=2017, "exlcude", "include")) %>% 
  filter(cutoff_2007 == "include" | is.na(cutoff_2007))

# 1976 as the first year; So we we only include surgeons who pass their initial certification after 1976
abs_gs_76_17 = abs_gs_2017 %>%  
  filter(Gcertyear>1975)


# nrow(abs_gs) - nrow(abs_gs_76_17) # 11880

```

### 3.1. Inclusion and Exclusion

Inclusion: 
 
  - Surgeons with NPI
  - Passed initial certification exam after 1976
   - ABS introduced time-limited MOC certification in 1976. So we we only include surgeons who pass their initial certification after 1976. This is also described in Andrew Jones MOC paper, *Certification data were collected from the ABS database for all surgeons initially certified in general surgery by the ABS between 1976 and 2005*.
  - Not qualified (10 years after initial certification) for exam after 2017 (exam change in 2017)
    - to address the exam changes in 2017, we excluded all surgeons who were qualified for recertification after(including) 2017. In our dataset, we don't have the recertifcation exam years for surgeons. So it's not possible to know if the surgeon took the exam before or after 2017. By excluding surgeons who were qualified to take the exam after 2017, we exclude the group who might have taken the exam after 2017. However, this also excluded some surgeons who took recertification exam earlier than 10 years after the initial certification.

Exclusion: 
 
  - Fellowship trained surgeons (n = `r n_exclude`). 
    - Fellowship information is from ABS and Fellowship Council data.
  
Below is the re-certification status for all qualified ABS surgeons. Very few surgeons have recorded failed re-certification status.  A large portion of surgeons didn't have re-certification records at all, i.e. NA.

```{r}
abs_w_recert = abs_gs_76_17 %>%
  mutate(
    npi = as.character(npi),
    Recert_status = case_when(
      ReCeverPassed == 0 ~ "failed",
      ReCeverPassed == 1 ~ "passed",
      is.na(ReCeverPassed) ~ "NA_failed"
    )
  ) 

abs_w_recert %>%
  count(Recert_status, name = "n suregon") %>%
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(`n suregon` / sum(`n suregon`))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

# nrow(abs_w_recert) #21581
if (medicare_gs_splty == FALSE){
  save(abs_w_recert, file = "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs/abs_w_recert.rdata")
} else if (medicare_gs_splty == TRUE){
    save(abs_w_recert, file = "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs/abs_w_recert_medicare_splty.rdata")
}

```



## 4. Data linkage

### 4.1 Link Medicare data with ABS data by NPI

### 4.2 Only keep cases that performed between 10-20 years after initial certification*

The ABS gives 10 years for surgeons for the recertification. We keep cases that 10 years after the initial certification to better capture the impact of the recertification process. However, we excluded cases happened 20 years after the initial certification to exclude the re-recertification effect,.e. only the first recertification cases were included in the cohort.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# # # link abs with medicare
# # medicare
medicare = data.table::fread("/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/standardized_medicare_data_using_R/analysis_ready_data/ecs_primary_surgeon_medicare2018.csv")

# abs general surgery surgeons
if (medicare_gs_splty == FALSE) {
  load(
    "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs/abs_w_recert.rdata"
  )
} else if (medicare_gs_splty == TRUE) {
  load(
    "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs/abs_w_recert_medicare_splty.rdata"
  )
}

abs_medicare = abs_w_recert %>%
  inner_join(medicare, by = c("npi" = "id_physician_npi"))

# number of ABS surgeons who have no medicare record
n_no_medicare_record = n_distinct(abs_w_recert$npi) - n_distinct(abs_medicare$npi)

# get 10 sample surgeons that didn't link with Medicare
set.seed(123)
abs_w_recert %>%
  filter(!npi %in% abs_medicare$npi) %>%
  group_by(Recert_status) %>%
  sample_n(3)

# only keep 10-20 years after initial certfication medicare cases -----
abs_medicare_10_20yr = abs_medicare %>%
  filter(facility_clm_yr - Gcertyear>10,
         facility_clm_yr - Gcertyear<=20)

n_exclude_10_20 = n_distinct(abs_medicare$npi) - n_distinct(abs_medicare_10_20yr$npi)

abs_medicare_npi = abs_medicare_10_20yr %>%
  select(npi)

# number of cases

  save(abs_medicare_npi, file = "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs_medicare_npi.rdata")

  save(n_no_medicare_record, n_exclude_10_20, file = "data/numbers_for_cohort_desp.RData")

  save(abs_medicare_10_20yr, file = "/Volumes/George_Surgeon_Projects/MOC_vs_Outcome/data/abs_medicare_10_20yr_medicare_splty.rdata")
}

# load data from above for fast markdown render

Link ABS with Medicare by NPI. Below is the number of surgeons by each recertification category after linked with Medicare outcomes.

```{r}
abs_w_recert %>%
  filter(npi %in% abs_medicare_npi$npi) %>%
  distinct(npi, Recert_status) %>%
  count(Recert_status, name = "n suregon") %>%
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(`n suregon` / sum(`n suregon`))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

n_lost = nrow(abs_w_recert) - n_distinct(abs_medicare_npi$npi)
perc = scales::percent(n_lost/nrow(abs_w_recert))
```

`r n_no_medicare_record` ABS surgeons don't have Medicare cases matched; `r n_exclude_10_20` surgeons don't have cases between 10 to 20 years after the initial certification.

## 5. Q&A

5.1 Did we exclude surgeons who didn't have enough time to pass Recertification exam? For example, if a surgeon only had 8 years after the initial certification, would the surgeon be excluded for the analysis?

In our study, we only included surgeons who were initially board certified before 2007. We have ABS data available up to 2019. So every surgeon in our study had at least 12 years of record after initial certification. ABS requires recertification every 10 years.


5.2 What if a surgeon passed the exam at year 12 after the initial certification? Would the surgeon be excluded because s/he didn't get certified within 10 years?

The surgeon is included. No criteria was about when the surgeon was re-certified. The recertified data we have is binary, without any year information of when the surgeons took the exam. So we can't know if the recertification was on-time or late.


5.3 Examples of how the recertification status were defined.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
abs_w_recert %>% 
  distinct(npi, Gcertyear, ReCeverPassed, Recert_status) %>% 
  group_by(Recert_status) %>% 
  sample_n(5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(npi = paste("surgeon", 1:15)) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

* Gcertyear: year of initial board certification; ReCeverPassed: Original ABS variable 0 (failed), 1 (passed)

5.4 Why included non-us grads? 

Followed the strategy of Andrew Jones MOC paper.
